No one spotted the things I left in the UML diagram so they were corrected.
Added some more Air around the classes, hopefully it looks better now.

The Observer issues was nicely spotted, I restored the code to take care of it. 
Actually what I left was a register everytime the Play method was called.

Regarding the Soft17 I think the implementation was correct (I might be wrong as I don't play cards). 
Though I moved the code from player into Sof17HitStrategy to make the rule clearer.
