The rules of the game is shown at startup.
This exposes a number of classes between View and Model and makes the reason to have a controller a bit questionable. 
A probably easier solution would be to drop the Controller and make a Model-View implementation.

I opt to make new packages to better keep new implementations. Some times it might not make sense but in this way I think
it is easier to follow the added on features, in a real case I would probably not have created new packages, I would rather
have used the existing once.
