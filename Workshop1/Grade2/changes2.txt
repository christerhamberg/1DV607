Updates done according to Johan Hagelbäck’s comments
 

* All use cases must be in one domain model.

Model changed to use UMLet as it is a free tool, and all use cases added into one model.
Cutting down on detail level to fit all in one sheet. Also removing some details that are more linked to Grade 3 requirements.
UMLet has a bug that it does not display arrows correctly in the .pdf format hence a .jpg is added as well to git.


* YachtClub shall not be a concept. 
  The whole system you model is a yacht club.

YachtClub was removed, highlight on Member and Secretary done instead to make it more "go with the book" but in real life I would probably not have 
included the members, they ought to be the domain owners/experts and should know what they are doing... 
But this dsign is now perhaps more inline with the book.


* The BearthAllocation should tie together a Boat and a Berth, and is managed by the Secretary. 
  To make an allocation you need both a Boat and a Berth, so you must have relations to both.

My original design was clearly too fuzzy about this, but the thought was that Berth Allocation is connected to YachtClub, 
which knows both the members (boats) and the berths. Design is now changed so that Berth allocation derives this information directly from Boat and Berth.
As in line with comment 1 YachtClub was removed.
