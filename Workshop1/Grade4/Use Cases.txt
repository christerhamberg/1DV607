When I handed in the last books borrowed at the university of Helsink I chatted with the lady at the same time 
and colletced the following use cases of her daily routines for this assignment:


1. Administration of Clients 
	(Create new Accounts/Issue new Library cards)	
	(Update existing contact information)
	(Remove Students that have graduated/left the university)
	
2. Handle Overdue books own studens
	Issue reminders
	Administrates Payments at return of Overdue books
	
3. Handle Overdue books borrowed to other Universites/Students of other Universites/Students
	Issue reminders to borrowing institution
	
4. Handling of books	
	Register new Book, Assign shelf, Department and setup the search criteria of the book
	Remove book
	Update book
	Inventory of books (whole library)
	
5. Search
	Locate books internaly
	Locate books at other universities
	
6. Special cases the IN and OUT shelf
	In shelf consits of books borrowed from other universities, upon reception the book is registered as received and a notification is sent to the requesting student
	Out shelf cosits in the same spirit of books borrowed to other universites, that should be shipped.
	Shipping consists of 3 different scenarios, pickup locally, express shipment, postal shipment
	Reserv books (move them to OUT shelf, pickup locally)
	
	
Assumptions made by me: 
- Clients are both staff and students and staff.
- A borrowed book is not the same as a book, as the hanling of the is different.
- Borrowed books from other universites was low volume, thus I don't use a Book Item in this case
- From the Overdue reminder's point of view the Client is institution in case it is borrowed to another university
- I didn't ask specifically about E-books hence only paper books are considered.
- Registry and Catalogue is considered to be the same.
- My assumption is that she has more tasks than this as well, but these were the main tasks mentioned by her.
