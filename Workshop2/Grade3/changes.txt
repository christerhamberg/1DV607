Grade 3

- Changed socialSecurityID from int to long
- Added usecase search
  Implemented searches are boattype, bornmonth and name
  I did not implement age as there was no need to implement all of them
- Added Authentication username = id password = secret + id i.e. if id = '1' password = secret1 id = 2 password = secret2 and so on
  Already this is hurting my sense of IS/IT security storing them to a file is a no way, in that case 
  we should implement the full IDM instead!
- Added a super user 0/super to be able to setup the first member(s)
- There is no requirment on what a logged in user can not do, hence all users can edit any user after they are logged in
  in a real case this should be locked so that the user can only edit its own data.

  As there are no requirments on this, the user once logedin is the same as a super user

- Added a better example file with a few users

Considerations for improvements:

- Validation and chopping the search string should be allocated to the same class, 
  to make sure that they are implemented at the same time in the same way.
  (REFACTORED!) by letting the search facade SearchFilterFacade extend the 
  validator class SearchStringValidatorExtractor.


- Refactoring of the View package is probably a good option as it is not a nice class at the moment.
  (NOT REFACTORED) But considered in the implementation of GRADE4
