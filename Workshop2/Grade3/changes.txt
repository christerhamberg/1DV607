Grade 3
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Changed socialSecurityID from int to long
- Added usecase search
  Implemented searches are boattype, bornmonth and name
  I did not implement age as there was no need to implement all of them
- Added Authentication username = id password = secret + id i.e. if id = '1' password = secret1 id = 2 password = secret2 and so on
  Already this is hurting my sense of IS/IT security storing them to a file is a no way, in that case 
  we should implement the full IDM instead!
- Added a super user 0/super to be able to setup the first member(s)
- There is no requirment on what a logged in user can not do, hence all users can edit any user after they are logged in
  in a real case this should be locked so that the user can only edit its own data.

  As there are no requirments on this, the user once logedin is the same as a super user

- Added a better example file with a few users

- The selection option is only done for Display Member, I assume that this should be added to all options where applicable
  and it will be done like that in grade4. I opt to leave this undone in grade 3 to be able to show how I think the 
  refactoring on the code should be done.

- Validation and chopping the search string should be allocated to the same class, 
  to make sure that they are implemented at the same time in the same way.
  (REFACTORED!) by letting the search facade SearchFilterFacade extend the 
  validator class SearchStringValidatorExtractor.


Considerations for improvements at this stage:
-------------------------------------------------------

- Refactoring of the View package is probably a good option as it is not a nice class at the moment.
  (NOT REFACTORED) But considered in the implementation of GRADE4. If this is not okay for grade3 let me know and I
  will copy paste the grade4 solution here as well.

- Refactor the selected filter option from Grade3, and apply the refactored solution to the rest of the options!

- Selection of data from menues etc. starts to become copy paste needs refactoring.
