Grade 4
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Refactoring of the controller class has been done
  Each use case is moved to its own use case with a common class that handles a few common functions
  Member filter option added to those functions that needs it

- Exposing Member to a lot of classes to implify the search handling compare to Grade 3
  One comment here, the use of a hasmap is not really that good anymore and it would make sence to
  refactor the code in Member to change it to someother type. As exposing the Member class reduces the need
  to pass a hashkey. Hashkey made sense in the original design but not that much any more.

- Adding error code mapper

- Refactoring of the search option now multiple searches can be made
  by either applying an AND/OR option or by filtering the list a search at the time.
  AND / OR option only support the following kind of search xxx AND yyy , xxx OR yyy , xxx AND yyy (then a more specifc result can be applied on the previous search by either adding OR or AND)
  '(' and ')' is not a part of the implementaion. And it is built from left to right, i.e. parsing of the search string is minimal.

- Corrected some bugs in Grade3 
	(Social security ID was not changed to long in all places
	some null string corrections have been made.

- Refactoring parts of the UI class.
	Added a basic Error pusher, which could be converted into an observer if needed.
